It also helps them to organize their brilliant ideas in a click.

## Tech stack used 💻

- Front end : It is is made using React, HTML and CSS and you can customize the look of the Boss Machine by accessing the code in the `src` folder. 

- Back end : It is made using `Express.js` and is present in the `server` folder.  

- Data base : It is organised using JavaScript and is present in `db.js` under `server` directory. The database uses `faker.js` to generate massive amounts of realistic fake data in `Node.js` and the `browser`.

- Tests ⚠️ : The tests are written using Mocha and Chai as the assertion library and are present in the `test` folder.
