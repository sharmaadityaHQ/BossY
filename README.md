# BossY  
### Introduction
This is an entire API and a unique employee management application to serve information for today's most accomplished entrepreneurs. It helps entrepreneurs keep track of their employees and handle all the annoying meetings that keep getting added to their busy schedule. It also helps them to organize their brilliant ideas in a click.  
### Usage  
You should have `node` installed in your system.  
**1.** `git clone https://github.com/sharmaaditya570191/BossY.git`  
**2.** Run `yarn install` in the root directory to install the dependencies.  
**3.** Run `node server.js` in the root directory to start the `server`.  
**4.** Now open another terminal and run `yarn start` to run the front-end.
### Technology Stack  
**1.** The front-end is made using React, HTML and CSS and you can customize the look of the Boss Machine by accessing the code in the `src` folder.  
**2.** The back-end is made using `Express.js` and is present in the `server` folder.  
**3.** The tests are written using Mocha and Chai as the assertion library and are present in the `test` folder.    
**4.** The database is organised using JavaScript and is present in `db.js` under `server` directory. The database uses `faker.js` to generate massive amounts of realistic fake data in `Node.js` and the `browser`.
